<p>
    Let me introduce myself. I am Can and I'm here to whine all about the industry. However, I am not sure if it is me that is
    problematic. I don't understand anything anymore. So, I will talk about my recent job hunt experience along with some toxic
    behaviour examples, I encountered during screening and interviews.
</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>
    So, another day has passed and I causally woke up to check my mails to see which companies has rejected me, for <em
        >god knows why</em
    > reasons. But wow, there was an invitation for an interview. Surprising but that made my day. I was again back to normal Can, with
    all my colors and smile<sup>1</sup>.

        I know these days are counted and this will too pass. But you don't feel exactly the way you planned when you're in the
        situation.
